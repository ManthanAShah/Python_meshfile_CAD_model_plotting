# Python_meshfile_CAD_model_plotting
This repository has codes to read triangularly mesh nastran files and plot the models in 3D. This shows use of triangular_mesh(), quiver3d() functions of Mayavi package in Python. This kind of CAD model visualization required in different scientific fields (e.g. FEM analysis, vector calculus etc). In the Examples folder .png output shown.
